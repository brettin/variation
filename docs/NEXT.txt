-done add building of reference genome to mosaik_build.pl
-done add sorting capability, freebayes needs sorted

add parallel capability in mosaik_align to proecess mkb files
in parallel producing bam files in parallel.

-done add script to build mosaik neural net files.

look into building a jump database from the reference genome.
look into output from freebayes "Opened BAM reader without index file, jumping is disabled."

combine mosaik_align.pl and bamtools_sort.pl into a single command. pipe
output from mosaik align to bamtools sort if that's possible.

AUG-26-2014

The test data is in variation/test/SAMN

Build a reference database on each of the awe clients.
	mkdir /data/reference
	mkdir /data/reference/mosaik
	all_entities_Genome -f scientific_name | grep Mycobacterium
	va-awe_mosaik_build_ref

Run a test manually to show that the pipeline codes work


THEN


Run a test using the submit script to produce a workflow
        source /kb/deployment/user-env.sh

Validate upload to shock.
        
Submit the workflow manually, watching the logs
        tail -f /data/awe/logs/client/error.log
        tail -f /data/awe/logs/client/event.log

FINALLY

Evaluate design of using a tar.gz file instead of a directory.
