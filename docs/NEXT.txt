-done add building of reference genome to mosaik_build.pl
-done add sorting capability, freebayes needs sorted

add parallel capability in mosaik_align to proecess mkb files
in parallel producing bam files in parallel.

add script to build mosaik neural net files.

look into building a jump database from the reference genome.
look into output from freebayes "Opened BAM reader without index file, jumping is disabled."

combine mosaik_align.pl and bamtools_sort.pl into a single command. pipe
output from mosaik align to bamtools sort if that's possible.
